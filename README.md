# ops_challenges
## This is a collection of my Ops Challenges from Code Fellows

This repo is all about my journey in coding.  Before this course, I had very little time writing code or scripts.  By the end of my 201 course, I feel more comfortable writing in both Bash and PowerShell.  In here, you can follow me as I start from a basic "Hello World" type script, to a more complicated script that has working functions, variables and even menus that the user can navigate with.

As I continue down this path as a Cybersecurity Expert, coding will be helpful in finding security vulnerabilities and also a better understanding on how malicious code works.  This greater understanding of the way code is used to manipulate a computer will be a great asset to have in this profession.

In 201 we learned how to backup and restore systems, Windows Command Line Tools and a lot about different methods to improve security on our devices.  We went into data restoration and removing malicious software from computers.  We set up and launched numerous virtual machines, both at home and on the cloud using AWS services.  We definitely covered a lot in these past 3 weeks.

I think my favorite Ops Challenge was one that we did early on.  It was simple. All it did was create folders with files inside, but it showed me just how much my creativity would be a useful tool in coding and in future Challenges.

For the Shell scripting, I can see how these would be useful in workplaces when you wanted to have more control and automation in setting up work computers.  If you had to manually go in and do each step, the process would take a considerably much longer amount of time.

I have revisited old script and played around with it in my freetime. This script has at this moment (2022-8-11) not been pushed to my Git.  I think I will continue to take apart and play with my existing code to see how different pieces can work together, or not.

Even though at the end of 201 I feel more comfortable reading and writing code, I plan on spending more time reading other people's code as a learning tool.  Like reading a story, we can take those tales of coding and apply what we learn to our own code. This will be something I continue to do throughout the rest of these courses. I plan on continuing to make improvements in not only what I code, but how I go about creating it.
